# googleUtil
Repository for downloading publicly shared files from Google Drive using the terminal - in linux etc. Supports large files.

Steps:
Step 1. Clone the repository.
Step 2. Run the command:
        python gDownloader.py GoogleFileID /path/for/this/file/to/download/file.extension

Sometimes, in google drive address bar, you get the folder ID, and not the file ID directly. In that case, right-click on the desired file and select "Get sharable link". You can locate the file ID there.
